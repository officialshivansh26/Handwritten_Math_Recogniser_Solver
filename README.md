## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that can **recognize and solve handwritten math expressions** from images. The model accurately detects numbers and mathematical symbols, solves the equations, and provides a step-by-step explanation. The system is deployed as a **responsive web application** with a draw feature for user-friendly interaction.

## 🎯 Features
- **Handwritten Math Recognition** using **Qwen**
- **Equation Solving** powered by **DeepSeekDistill & LLaMA 70B**
- **Real-time Solution with Step-by-Step Explanation**
- **Interactive Website** developed with **React & Flask**
- **Draw Feature** for direct input and solution generation
- **Cloud-based Deployment** using **Cloudflare & Postman API**

## 📊 Model Development
| Model | Accuracy |
|--------|----------|
| CNN | 91% |
| EfficientNet | 93% |
| ResNet | 93% |
| DenseNet | 97% |
| Qwen | Improved Recognition |
| DeepSeekDistill + LLaMA 70B | Improved Solving |
