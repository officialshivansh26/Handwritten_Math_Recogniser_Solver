üßÆ OCR-Based Handwritten Mathematical Equation Solver API
This project provides an end-to-end solution to extract handwritten mathematical equations from images and solve them using state-of-the-art AI models. It combines Qwen2.5 Vision-Language Model for OCR-based extraction and Groq's deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b model for solving equations. The API is built using Flask-RESTful and exposed publicly via Cloudflare Tunnel.

üöÄ Features
OCR Extraction: Extracts mathematical equations from rough handwritten images using Qwen2.5-VL.

Equation Solving: Solves extracted equations using Groq deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b via LangChain function calling.

Step-by-step Explanation: Provides detailed, simplified solutions.

CORS Enabled: Ready for frontend integration.

Public API Exposure: Uses Cloudflare Tunnel for public endpoint access (no need for hosting).

üìÇ Installation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install required libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install fastapi uvicorn nest-asyncio pyngrok
pip install torch bitsandbytes
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate
pip install qwen-vl-utils[decord]==0.0.8
pip install langchain_groq jsbeautifier
pip install python-multipart flask_restful
pip install flask-cors
üîë Set Environment Variable
Replace YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY with your actual Groq API Key:

python
Copy
Edit
os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
üèóÔ∏è How it Works:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Upload:
Upload a rough handwritten image of a mathematical equation via /extract_solve/ POST endpoint.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Equation Extraction:
Uses Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct to extract the handwritten equation.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Equation Solving:
Sends the extracted equation to Groq's Llama 70B model using LangChain function calling.

Provides step-by-step solution and explanation.

üì° API Usage
Endpoint:
bash
Copy
Edit
POST /extract_solve/
Form-Data Parameter:
Key	Type	Description
file	File (.jpg/.png)	Handwritten equation image file
Example CURL:
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/extract_solve/ -F "file=@your_equation_image.jpg"
Response:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "status": "success",
  "extracted_equation": "x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0",
  "solution_status": "solved",
  "solution": "x = 2, x = -4",
  "explanation": "The quadratic equation is solved using the quadratic formula..."
}
üåê Cloudflare Tunnel
To expose the API publicly:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64 -o cloudflared
chmod +x cloudflared
./cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8003
Cloudflare will provide a public URL, making it easy to test from anywhere or integrate with frontends.

‚úÖ Future Enhancements
Add Graph plotting of equations as base64 images.

Integrate with frontend dashboard.

Support batch image solving.

Deploy on permanent cloud infrastructure.
